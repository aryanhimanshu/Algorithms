# STACK :part_alternation_mark:
- A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
- In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. 
- A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. 
- Push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top.
- A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books, you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.
